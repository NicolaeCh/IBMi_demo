present_ip_interface
=========
The role is to present an ip interface and make it active. The workflow is that:
1. If the internet_address does exist, make it active.
2. If the internet_address doesn't exist, create it based on the given line_description. 
3. If the given line_description doesn't exist, create it
4. If the next_hop is provided, create a router based on it.

| `autoStart`            | str          | False | *YES    | Specifies whether the interface is automatically started. Default                     |
| `preferredInterface`   | str           | False |  *NONE   | A list of preferred IPv4 interfaces that are to be used with the IPv4 interface being added for proxy. |
| `textDescription`            | False |     | *BLANK         | Specifies text that briefly describes the interface. |
| `secToWait`      | int          | False |  0   | The number of seconds that the module waits after executing the task before returning the information of the internet address..                      |
| `extraParams`          | str           | False | ''  |  The extra parameters that the user wants to pass into ibmi_tcp_interface module. |

| `route_destination`      | str          | False  |  *DFTROUTE   |Specifies the route destination being added. |
| `next_hop`      | str          | False |     |Specifies the internet address of the next system (gateway) on the route.                          .                      |
