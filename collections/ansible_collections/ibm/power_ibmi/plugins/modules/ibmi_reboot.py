module: ibmi_reboot
short_description: Reboot an IBM i machine
version_added: '1.0.0'
description:
    - Reboot a IBM i machine, wait for it to go down, come back up, and respond to commands.
options:
  pre_reboot_delay:
    description:
      - Seconds to wait before issue the reboot command.
    type: int
    default: 60
  post_reboot_delay:
    description:
      - Seconds to wait after the reboot command was successful before attempting to validate the system rebooted successfully.
      - This is useful if you want wait for something to settle despite your connection already working.
    type: int
    default: 60
  reboot_timeout:
    description:
      - Maximum seconds to wait for machine to reboot and respond to a test command.
      - This timeout is evaluated separately for both reboot verification and test command success so the
        maximum execution time for the module is twice this amount.
    type: int
    default: 1800
  connect_timeout:
    description:
      - Maximum seconds to wait for a successful connection to the managed hosts before trying again.
      - If unspecified, the default setting for the underlying connection plugin is used.
    type: int
    default: 300
  test_command:
    description:
      - Command to run on the rebooted host and expect success from to determine the machine is ready for further tasks.
    type: str
    default: 'uname'
  msg:
    description:
      - Message to display to users before reboot.
    type: str
    default: 'Reboot initiated by Ansible'
  how_to_end:
    description:
      - Specifies whether the system allows the active subsystem to end processing of active jobs in a controlled manner.
        or whether the system ends the jobs immediately. In either case, the system does perform certain job-cleanup functions.
    type: str
    default: '*IMMED'
    choices: ['*IMMED', '*CNTRLD']
  controlled_end_delay_time:
    description:
      - Specifies the amount of time(1-99999), in seconds, that the system allows a controlled end to be performed by the active subsystems.
      - If the value is greater than 99999, C(*NOLIMIT) will be used in PWRDWNSYS commnad.
    type: int
    default: 600
  reboot_type:
    description:
      - Specifies the point from which the initial program load (IPL) restarts.
    type: str
    default: '*IPLA'
    choices: ['*IPLA', '*SYS', '*FULL']
  ipl_source:
    description:
      - Specifies whether an initial-program-load (IPL) is started from the A-source, B-source or D-source of the system.
    type: str
    default: '*PANEL'
    choices: ['*PANEL', 'A', 'B', 'D', '*IMGCLG']
  end_subsystem_option:
    description:
      - Specifies the options to take when ending the active.
    type: str
    default: '*DFT'
    choices: ['*DFT', '*NOJOBLOG', '*CHGPTY', '*CHGTSL']
  timeout_option:
    description:
      - Specifies the option to take when the system does not end within the time limit specified by the QPWRDWNLMT system value.
      - If this time limit is exceeded, the subsequent IPL will be abnormal regardless of the value specified for this parameter.
    type: str
    default: '*CONTINUE'
    choices: ['*CONTINUE', '*MSD', '*SYSREFCDE']
  parameters:
    description:
      - The parameters that PWRDWNSYS command will take.
      - Other than options above, all other parameters need to be specified here.
      - The default values of parameters for PWRDWNSYS will be taken if not specified.
      - Only Install PTF device(INSPTFDEV) is supported now for IBMi 7.3 and above.
    type: str
    default: ''
  become_user:
    description:
      - The name of the user profile that the IBM i task will run under.
      - Use this option to set a user with desired privileges to run the task.
    type: str
  become_user_password:
    description:
      - Use this option to set the password of the user specified in C(become_user).
    type: str
notes:
    - ansible.cfg needs to specify interpreter_python=/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/python3 under[defaults] section.
    - Be careful to use C(*CNTRLD) for option how_to_end,
      you need to specify the appropriate value for all the timout options according to the system performance.
